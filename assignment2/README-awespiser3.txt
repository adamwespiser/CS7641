To run my code, clone the following repo:
$ git clone https://github.com/adamwespiser/CS7641.git

Then, download the working branch corresponding to this project:
$ git pull origin gce

Next, you need to make sure you have downloaded and install jython, available here: https://www.jython.org/downloads.html

finally, cd into CS7641/assignment2 and run the code with:
./run_it.sh

Note: you may need to edit run_it.sh to specify the exact location of your jython executable, which will be system specific. The defaults in run_it.sh are reflective of a Ubuntu 16.04 set up.
All the data files are committed to within the repository!
Thanks! awespiser3 :)
